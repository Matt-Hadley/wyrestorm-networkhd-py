## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** (see `pyproject.toml` for exact requirements)
- **Git** for version control
- **Make** (optional but recommended for using project commands)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Matt-Hadley/wyrestorm-networkhd-py.git
cd wyrestorm-networkhd-py

# Complete development environment setup
make install
```

This single command will:

- Create a Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Install all development dependencies
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Validate your environment

### Manual Setup (if Make is not available)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,rs232,docs]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## 🧪 Testing and Quality

### Development Workflow Commands

```bash
# Daily development workflow: format → lint → test (fast)
make dev-workflow

# Individual commands
make format           # Format code with Ruff and Prettier
make lint            # Run linting checks
make test            # Run all tests
make test-fast       # Run only fast unit tests
make test-cov        # Run tests with coverage report
make check           # Run all quality checks
make build           # Build and validate package

# Comprehensive validation (before commits/releases)
make health-check    # Full project validation
make pre-commit      # Run pre-commit hooks

# See all available commands
make help
```

### Test Categories

Tests are organized into categories using pytest markers:

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
make test-fast
# or: pytest -m "unit"

# Integration tests (require device/mocking)
pytest -m "integration"

# Performance tests (slow, benchmark-focused)
pytest -m "performance"

# All tests
make test
```

### Code Quality Standards

- **Line Length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Formatter**: Ruff (replaces Black and isort)
- **Linter**: Ruff + MyPy for type checking
- **Security**: Bandit for security analysis
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically run on commit

## 📝 Code Style and Standards

### Python Style

- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines (enforced by Ruff)
- Use **type hints** for all function signatures
- Write **comprehensive docstrings** using Google style
- Maximum **line length of 120 characters**

### Docstring Example

````python
async def send_command(self, command: str, timeout: float = 10.0) -> str:
    """Send a command to the NetworkHD device.

    Args:
        command: The command string to send to the device.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for response in seconds.

    Returns:
        The response string from the device.

    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If not connected to the device.
        CommandError: If the command fails or times out.

    Example:
        ```python
        response = await client.send_command("matrix get")
        ```
    """
````

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/description`: New features or enhancements
- `fix/description`: Bug fixes
- `docs/description`: Documentation updates
- `refactor/description`: Code refactoring without behavior changes
- `test/description`: Test improvements or additions

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes (no code logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

## 🔧 Advanced Development

### Logging and Debugging

The package includes comprehensive logging for development and debugging:

#### Default Logging Configuration

- **Console output** at INFO level by default
- **Structured logging** with timestamps and module names
- **Configurable levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

#### Customizing Logging During Development

```python
from wyrestorm_networkhd.logging_config import setup_logging

# Enable verbose debug logging
setup_logging(level="DEBUG")

# Log to file for analysis
setup_logging(
    level="DEBUG",
    log_file="logs/development.log"
)

# Custom format for development
setup_logging(
    level="DEBUG",
    log_format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)8s] %(name)s: %(message)s"
)
```

#### Environment Variable Control

```bash
# Set log level via environment
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python your_development_script.py

# Enable all debug output during testing
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG make test
```

#### What Gets Logged

- **DEBUG**: Command/response details, SSH operations, connection state changes
- **INFO**: Connection events, command execution, major operations
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues, fallback behaviors
- **ERROR**: Connection failures, command errors, exceptions
- **CRITICAL**: System failures, unrecoverable errors

### Working with Real Devices

When developing with actual NetworkHD devices:

```python
# Enable detailed logging for device interaction
from wyrestorm_networkhd.logging_config import setup_logging
setup_logging(level="DEBUG")

# Test with real device
client = NetworkHDClientSSH(
    host="192.168.1.100",
    port=10022,
    username="wyrestorm",
    password="networkhd",
    ssh_host_key_policy="warn"  # Use "warn" for development
)

async with client:
    # Your development code here
    response = await client.send_command("help")
    print(f"Device response: {response}")
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Connection pooling**: Consider implications of multiple connections
- **Command batching**: Group related commands when possible
- **Resource cleanup**: Always use context managers (`async with`)
- **Error recovery**: Implement proper retry logic for network issues

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep protocol handling separate from API logic
- **Type safety**: Use type hints and data classes extensively
- **Error handling**: Provide specific exception types
- **Async patterns**: Use proper async/await patterns throughout

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Development Security

- **Never commit credentials** or device information
- **Use secure defaults** in examples and tests
- **Validate all inputs** especially those from devices
- **Handle sensitive data** (passwords, tokens) securely

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email: 81762940+Matt-Hadley@users.noreply.github.com

- Subject: `[SECURITY] WyreStorm NetworkHD - [Brief Description]`
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Provide suggested fixes if possible

## 📚 Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear, concise language** accessible to developers of all levels
- **Working code examples** that can be copy-pasted
- **Type hints** in all code examples
- **Error handling** shown in examples when relevant
- **Keep examples up-to-date** with API changes

### Building Documentation
