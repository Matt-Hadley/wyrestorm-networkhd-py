A Python client library for WyreStorm NetworkHD devices, providing a high-level interface for device control and
monitoring. Supports all major command categories including matrix switching, device control, video walls, multiview,
and more.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wyrestorm-networkhd
```

## Quick Start

```python
from wyrestorm_networkhd import NetworkHDClientSSH, NHDAPI

# Create client with SSH connection
client = NetworkHDClientSSH(
    host="192.168.1.100",
    username="wyrestorm",
    password="networkhd",
    ssh_host_key_policy="warn"
)

# Use with context manager
async with client:
    # Create API wrapper
    api = NHDAPI(client)

    # Execute commands and get typed responses
    device_list = await api.api_query.get_devicelist()
    matrix_info = await api.api_query.matrix_get()
    await api.video_wall.scene_active("office", "splitmode")
```

## Features

- **Strongly Typed**: Full type hints and data models for all API responses
- **Async/Await Support**: Built for modern Python async applications
- **SSH Connection**: Secure SSH connections with configurable host key policies
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: All NetworkHD API commands supported
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with custom exception types
- **Context Manager Support**: Clean resource management
- **Real-time Notifications**: Built-in notification handling for device status updates

## API Categories

API categories match those in the API Reference (see below).

- **System Configuration**: Version info, IP settings, device lists
- **Device Configuration**: Device names, info, and status
- **Matrix Switching**: Video, audio, USB, infrared, and serial routing
- **Video Walls**: Scene management and logical screen control
- **Multiview**: Preset and custom layout management
- **Device Control**: Reboot, reset, and port switching
- **Notifications**: Real-time device status updates

## Logging

The package includes comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring. Logging is configured automatically but can be
customized.

### Default Logging

By default, logs are output to the console at INFO level. The following events are logged:

- **INFO**: Connection establishment/disconnection, command execution
- **DEBUG**: Detailed command/response data, SSH connection details
- **ERROR**: Connection failures, command errors

### Customizing Logging

```python
from wyrestorm_networkhd.logging_config import setup_logging

# Set debug level for verbose output
setup_logging(level="DEBUG")

# Log to file
setup_logging(level="INFO", log_file="logs/wyrestorm_networkhd.log")

# Custom format
setup_logging(
    level="DEBUG",
    log_format="%(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s"
)
```

### Log Levels

- **DEBUG**: All details including commands, responses, and SSH operations
- **INFO**: Connection events and command execution (default)
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Errors and failures
- **CRITICAL**: Critical system failures

### Environment Variables

Set `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control logging level:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python your_script.py
```

## Security Configuration

The SSH client requires explicit SSH host key verification policy selection to ensure users make conscious security
decisions.

### Security Recommendations

SSH Client:

- **Production Environments**: Use `"reject"` or `"warn"` policies (warn is default)
- **Development/Testing**: Use `"auto_add"` policy
- **Controlled Networks**: `"auto_add"` may be acceptable if network security is assured Logging:
- **Monitor Logs**: Always monitor logs for security warnings when using permissive policies

## Real-time Notifications

The client includes built-in support for real-time device notifications:

```python
from wyrestorm_networkhd import NetworkHDClientSSH

client = NetworkHDClientSSH(host="192.168.1.100", username="admin", password="secret", ssh_host_key_policy="warn")

# Register notification callbacks
def on_device_status(notification):
    print(f"Device {notification.device} is {'online' if notification.online else 'offline'}")

def on_cec_data(notification):
    print(f"CEC data from {notification.device}: {notification.data}")

# Register callbacks for different notification types
client.register_notification_callback("endpoint", on_device_status)
client.register_notification_callback("cec", on_cec_data)

# Connect and start receiving notifications
await client.connect()
# Notifications will be automatically handled while connected
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

This project uses pytest for comprehensive testing with coverage reporting.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# For verbose output
VERBOSE=1 make test
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Async Tests**: Tests for async functionality using `@pytest.mark.asyncio`

### VS Code Integration

The project includes VS Code configuration for:

- **Testing Panel**: Run and debug tests directly in the editor
- **Coverage Display**: Visual coverage indicators in the gutter
- **Debug Configurations**: Debug tests with breakpoints
- **Tasks**: Quick access to common testing operations

Install the recommended extensions and reload VS Code to enable testing features.
